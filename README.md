## Introduction

This is the repository for the Repeated Environmental Behavior Latent
(REBL) Scale project. It contains all the code to build the REBL scale
from raw data through visualizations.

## REBL Package

### Installation

To install the `rebl` package:

``` r
if (!require('remotes')) install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github('tshrum/rebl')
```

### Usage

See vignette for an example of how to use the package.

## REBL Calculator

There is also a [REBL Score
Calculator](https://cdonov12.w3.uvm.edu/rebl_calculator/) that will take
a dataset and produce all the results you might need for you. Note that
it currently has a limited range of applications, but will be updated
with more features and broader use cases shortly.
