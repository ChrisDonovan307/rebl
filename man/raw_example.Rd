\description{
The unprocessed dataset containing simulated responses to the
REBL survey from 100 participants. This dataset contains character
responses ("Yes"/"No") for 24 REBL items measuring pro-environmental
behaviors across four domains: food, home, packaging, social, and water.
}
\details{
This dataset contains the original character-coded responses from the
REBL survey before any processing. It represents how participants actually
responded to each survey item. This data can be processed using functions
like \code{\link{recode_rebl}} to convert to numeric format for analysis.
